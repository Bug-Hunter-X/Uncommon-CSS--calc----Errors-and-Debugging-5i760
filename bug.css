The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you make a mistake in the calculation, it might lead to unexpected results. For example, using incorrect operators or units can cause the calculation to fail silently, leading to elements not rendering correctly.  Another issue is that browser support for `calc()` might vary, especially with more complex calculations. This means your layout could appear correctly in some browsers but not others. Finally, nesting `calc()` within `calc()` can cause unexpected outcomes in some browsers, making it hard to debug.
